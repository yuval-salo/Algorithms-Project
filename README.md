# Algorithms-Project
Implemention of several ways to solve the problem of minimum distances from a single origin to a single target in directed graphs,
and calculate the time running of the solutions.

The Ways are:
1. Dijkstra's algorithm - When the priority queue is implemented by a minimum Heap.
2. Dijkstra's algorithm - When the priority queue is implemented by a regular Array .
3. Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm.

For each of the algorithms, the program will run the algorithm once when the graph is implemented by a Adjacency matrix and a second time by a Adjacency list.

In every run of algorithm,the program measure the time taken to compute it, and print the results to an external file (received via command line argument).

*This project was build as a part of "Algorithms" Course, taken in The Academic College of Tel Aviv - Yaffo, Computer Science Faculty.
