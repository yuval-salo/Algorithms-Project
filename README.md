# Algorithms-Project
Implemention of several ways to solve the problem of minimum distances from a single origin to a single target in directed graphs,
and calculate the time running of the solutions.

The Ways are:
1. Dijkstra's algorithm - When the priority queue is implemented by a minimum Heap.
2. Dijkstra's algorithm - When the priority queue is implemented by a regular Array .
3. Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm.

For each of the algorithms, the program will run the algorithm once when the graph is implemented by a Adjacency matrix and a second time by a Adjacency list.
